# AlgoMasters
Overview
This Java program is a Sorting Algorithms Performance Analyzer that allows you to analyze and compare the performance of several sorting algorithms. The program provides the following features:

Comparison of execution time for different sorting algorithms.
Display of algorithm complexities.
Custom sorting of a user-specified dataset.
Algorithms available: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Radix Sort.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
You need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse is recommended, but not mandatory.
Installation
Clone this repository or download the source code to your local machine.

If you are using an IDE like Eclipse:

Open Eclipse.
Select "File" > "Open Projects from File System..."
Click "Directory" and navigate to the directory where you have saved the source code.
Click "Finish."
If you are using the command line:

Navigate to the project's root directory.

Compile the program by running the following command:javac SortingAlgorithms.java
Run the program:

If you are using Eclipse, you can run the program by right-clicking the SortingAlgorithms.java file and selecting "Run As" > "Java Application."

If you are using the command line, run the program with:java SortingAlgorithms

Usage
Upon running the program, you will be presented with a menu with the following options:

Compare algorithm performance: This option allows you to compare the execution time of sorting algorithms for different dataset sizes.

Algorithm complexities: View the time complexities of the available sorting algorithms.

Custom sort: Perform a custom sort on a dataset of your choice.

Exit: Exit the program.

Custom Sorting
When selecting the "Custom sort" option, you will be prompted to enter the size of your dataset, the minimum and maximum values for the dataset, and the sorting algorithm of your choice. The program will then display the sorted dataset along with the time taken for the sorting process.
